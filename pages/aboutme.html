    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>Hi, I am a highschool student from Canada and this is my website! I have dreams of achieving big 
       things and becoming successful. In my current quadmester I am taking Chemistry and Computer science.

    <h3>My Interests and hobbies</h3>
    <p>I have many interests and hobbies including music, basketball, and gaming. Since a young age 
        I have been listening to music. Myy taste in music progreessed through the years and I started 
        expanding and listening to new genres. At the moment my favourite genres are Rap and R&B. 
        My favourite artists that I listen to frequently are J Cole, Bryson Tiller, and 6lack. My
        favourite album at the moment is 4 Your Eyez Only by J Cole.
        I have been playing basketball since 2012 when I was 8 years old. Since then I've played almost 
        everyday because I fell in love with the sport. I watch a lot of NBA and NCAA basketball games to 
        learn more about the sport. My favourite NBA team is the Chicago Bulls 
        and my favourite player is Demar Derozan.</p>

    <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
    <p> Throughout my time in high school and middle school, I have received many academic and athletic awards. 
        For example I have received many 1st place and 2nd place awards in Basketball and Soccer,
        I received a Citizenship award for my positive actions within my community 
        in grade 8. In high school, I have yet to accomplish as much as middle school because many of 
        my plans were affected by Covid-19.
