    <h3>Computer science and Tech experience</h3>
    <p>I don't have a lot of experience with programming or coding. 
        The only things I have ever programmed were these educational toys called Spheros. 
        My elementary school bought them and taught us how to program them to move. Other than that the only 
        other time I have seen code is the Inspect element on a website. In the future I hope to learn many 
        coding languages like C++. I think the skill of coding a website will be very useful in my futre and I
        recommend everyone to learn how to code.

    <h3>Why did I take the computer science course?</h3>
    <p>I heard that the course is fun and helpful. 
        This lead me to do more research and ask more about the course.
        Every person I asked and every article I read all spoke positive things about the course and the
        things that are taught. In addition to this, after a few weeks in this course I came to a realization
        that I will use the skills taught in the future for many things.
